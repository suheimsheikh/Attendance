## 7 Jul 2026 — Attendance Report drill-down tooltips (updated)

**Update, later same day:** the native `title=` tooltip proved
too slow / unreliable inside the horizontally-scrolling table
(browser default delay ~1s, and some Chrome versions suppress it
inside overflow-auto containers). Replaced with a portal-rendered
custom hover popover (`DrillDownBubble`):

- Instant show/hide via `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` (no delay).
- Positioned above the hovered cell (auto-flips below near viewport
  top), rendered into `document.body` so it escapes the table's
  scroll clip and z-index stack.
- Dark slate skin with white text, single shared state in `Reports`
  (only one bubble on screen at any time).
- `cursor-help` only applied when the cell has non-empty dates —
  empty categories stay plain.
- Data-testid `drilldown-tooltip` on the bubble for automated tests.
- Verified end-to-end via Playwright on ARUNA SURUGU's absent cell:
  bubble reads "ABSENT · 2 / Wed, Jul 01 / Fri, Jul 03".

## 7 Jul 2026 — Attendance Report drill-down tooltips

**What shipped**
- `/api/reports/hours` (payroll) rows now include ISO-date arrays for
  every count column on the Attendance table:
  `dates_present`, `dates_off`, `dates_absent`, `dates_late`,
  `dates_leave`, `dates_tour`, `dates_break`, `dates_half_day`,
  `dates_comp_off_earned`, `dates_comp_off_applied`,
  `dates_comp_off_used`, `dates_escort`, `dates_overtime_served`,
  `dates_overtime_applied`, `dates_overtime_approved`.
- Every count column in `Reports.jsx` now has a native `title=`
  drill-down tooltip listing the exact dates on hover (formatted as
  "Mon, Jul 04"), plus `cursor-help` so admins know the number is
  interactive.
- Invariants held: `len(dates_X) == count_X`, all dates inside the
  report window, sorted + unique.

**Tests**
- New: `backend/tests/test_report_drill_down_dates.py` — 4 tests
  covering presence of keys, count-length parity, window bounds, and
  sort/dedup.
- Existing 389+ passing tests untouched.

**Files touched**
- `backend/server.py` — added `_days_of_type`, `_break_days`,
  extended half-day tracking, added dates arrays to payroll rows.
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Reports.jsx` — added `tip()` helper +
  `title`/`cursor-help` on 13 cells across Attendance / Comp-Off /
  Overtime / Escorts groups.
