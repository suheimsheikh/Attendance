# I Showed Up — Browser-based Campus Attendance App

## Original Problem Statement
> Need to create a new app called I-showed-up that needs to take all the code and database from the Attendance app (attendance-app-220) I already created which was a mobile app but this needs to be a browser based app.

## Source
- Existing FastAPI/MongoDB backend reused verbatim from GitHub repo `suheimsheikh/Attendance`.
- MongoDB data migrated via `mongorestore` from user-provided `attendance_db_export.tar.gz` — 1 admin user, 1 office config, 6 leaves, 1 attendance, 0 devices.

## Architecture
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Motor + MongoDB. Same `server.py` (1333 lines) — port-direct reuse. JWT auth. Located at `/app/backend/server.py`.
- **Frontend:** React 19 + CRA + craco + Tailwind CSS + React Router 7 + sonner toasts. Lucide icons. Located at `/app/frontend/src`.
- **DB:** MongoDB (`mongodb://localhost:27017`, `DB_NAME=test_database`). Same name as source — data migrated 1:1.

## Tech Stack Differences vs Mobile
| Concern              | Mobile (Expo)              | Web (this app)                       |
|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| QR scan              | `expo-camera`              | `html5-qrcode` (webcam)              |
| Geolocation          | `expo-location`            | `navigator.geolocation`              |
| Device ID            | `expo-secure-store` UUID   | `localStorage` UUID (`web-…`)        |
| Token storage        | `expo-secure-store`        | `localStorage`                       |
| Excel up/download    | `expo-document-picker`     | HTML `<input type=file>` + blob DL   |
| QR code render       | `react-native-qrcode-svg`  | `react-qr-code`                      |

## User Personas
- **Admin** — manages members, approves devices/leaves, configures office geofence, prints QR cards, runs reports.
- **Member (sailor/staff/coach)** — signs in via phone (browser-approved by admin) or via admin email login, checks in/out (QR or GPS), views own stats, applies for leave/tour.

## What's Implemented (Jan 2026)
### Backend (reused, verified ✅)
- `/api/auth/login` — admin email/password login
- `/api/auth/phone` + `/api/auth/phone/status` — passwordless phone login with admin approval polling
- `/api/auth/me`
- `/api/members` CRUD, `/api/members/me/photo`, `/api/members/import-template`, `/api/members/import` (Excel)
- `/api/admin/devices` (list/approve/reject/revoke)
- `/api/office` GET/PUT, `/api/office/regenerate-qr`
- `/api/attendance/checkin`, `/checkout`, `/geo-toggle`, `/mark-member`, `/scan-card`, `/status`
- `/api/admin/attendance/toggle/{id}`
- `/api/leaves` (mine, all, decide), `/api/presence`, `/api/me/stats`, `/api/admin/summary`
- `/api/reports/hours` + export (CSV / PDF), `/api/reports/daily` + export
- `/api/admin/cards`

### Frontend (new web build)
- **Auth:** Login page with phone-login + collapsible admin email form; pending-approval polling UI.
- **Layout:** Persistent dark slate sidebar (desktop) + mobile hamburger drawer. Role-aware navigation.
- **Member pages:** Presence Board (with status filters, live refresh, stat cards), Check-In/Out (QR scan + GPS modes, off-site reason flow, geofence display), My Leaves (apply leave/tour modal), Profile (avatar upload, weekly/monthly stats, recent attendance).
- **Admin pages:** Console (5 KPIs + 8 quick actions), Members (search, CRUD, force check-in/out), Leave Approvals (filter+approve/reject), Access Requests (approve devices into new or existing members), Office Settings (geofence pick-here button, timezone, late grace), Office QR (print-ready with regenerate), Member Cards (print all personal QRs), Reports (hours + daily, CSV/PDF export), Import Members (xlsx upload).
- **UX:** Light theme with dark slate/graphite brand, semantic status colors (emerald on-campus, orange tour, amber leave, gray exited), accessible via `data-testid` on every interactive element.

## Backlog / Next Steps
| Priority | Item |
|----------|------|
| P1 | Frontend end-to-end smoke test (manual or testing-agent run) to confirm scanner, geolocation, and admin flows in a real browser session. |
| P2 | Add validators on `LeaveCreate` (date format + start≤end) — minor backend gap noted by testing agent. |
| P2 | Add a `members/{id}/reset-card` endpoint (regenerate personal QR if a card is lost). |
| P2 | Optional UI polish: skeleton states for admin pages, empty-state illustrations. |
| P2 | Migrate existing user emails from `@sailors.local` → `@athletes.local` (cleanup). |
| P2 | PWA install prompt ("Add to Home Screen") for Coaches/Staff. |
| P2 | Add "Institution" filter pills to Muster Roll. |
| P3 | WebP logo variants for faster loading. |
| P3 | Split `server.py` (>2600 lines) into focused routers. |

## Recently Added (Feb 2026)
- **YCH branding & color palette**: Navy / Teal / Coral / Gold / Sky CSS variables across the app.
- **Parent / Guardian contact (Feb 2026)**: Added `father_mobile`, `mother_mobile`, `guardian_mobile` to `UserPublic`, `MemberCreate`, `MemberUpdate`. Admin can enter all three in the Member Form. A reusable `ParentContact` popover (sky-blue phone chip) renders next to every athlete name on **Presence Board**, **Muster Roll**, **Members list**, and **Reports → Hours**, exposing one-tap `tel:` (Call) and `sms:` (Message) actions for each parent on file. Backend endpoints `/api/presence`, `/api/muster/athletes`, `/api/reports/hours` now include the parent numbers.
- **Bilingual auto-SMS notifications (Feb 2026)**: One-tap "Notify parents" + "Late SMS" buttons on the Presence Board:
  - Opens the device's native SMS app pre-populated with all parent numbers (zero send-cost) and a **bilingual English + Telugu** message body that includes the current admin contacts and the logged-in coach's mobile as call-back numbers.
  - **`not_arrived`**: appears on Absent-column rows once `now > work_start + parent_notify_grace_minutes` (default 30, configurable in `OfficeConfig`).
  - **`late`**: appears on On-Campus rows that were checked in past `work_start + late_grace_minutes`.
  - Dispatches are recorded in a new `parent_notifications` collection so each athlete only gets one "not arrived" + one "late" SMS per day (`POST /api/parent-notify/dispatch`); the button auto-replaces with a muted "SMS sent" pill once dispatched.
  - Presence response now also returns `admin_contacts`, `notify_grace_minutes`, and per-row `notify_due`/`notified_today` flags.
